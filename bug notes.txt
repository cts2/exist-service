A few issues have been observed in the underlying existDB.

Collection Removals are logging FATAL errors during testing:
https://sourceforge.net/p/exist/bugs/829/
Not sure if these are harmful or not - they may be corrupting the recovery log.  Doesn't impact any tests.

Collection Removal can deadlock the main thread if another thread is active:
https://sourceforge.net/p/exist/bugs/830/

The Lucene indexes are logging a warning upon server start.  This has been investigated, and is harmless.
https://sourceforge.net/p/exist/bugs/828/

The nuisance warnings that are logged when checking to see if a resource exits has been logged as a bug:
https://sourceforge.net/p/exist/bugs/827/
This causes the WARN : org.exist.xmldb.LocalCollection - Resource counter not found messages.  These are harmless.
